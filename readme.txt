// XSDTool is a utility to create Class-definitions from an XSD file.
// it is based on JanXMLParser which can be found at
// http://www.jansfreeware.com
//   I had to slightly modify the parser because it had a memory leak.
//   the corrected version is part of this archive.
// I also used MRUFileList from Brad Stowers.
//   unfortunately his delphi-free-stuff pages are no longer available.
//   the unit therefore is included here.
//
// XSDobj and XSDparser are mine and can be used freely for everybody.
// XMLTools is mine and can also be used freely.
// Mylib is a collection of usefull and not so useful routines, but
//   included in almost all my projects. See what you can do with it.
